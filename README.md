# Project Definition
    In this experiment, I was supposed to develop a simple Movie Database System similar to IMDB1.
    I was responsible for using inheritance mechanism and access modiﬁers in Java programming language.
    The system will process several data input ﬁles and will generate results of commands which 
    will be read from a command input ﬁle.
    For further problem description please review the file "BBM104-Experiment_5.pdf" in the "res" folder.
