# Project Definition
    In this experiment, I was supposed to develop a simple Movie Database System similar to IMDB1.<br />
    I was responsible for using inheritance mechanism and access modiﬁers in Java programming language.<br />
    The system will process several data input ﬁles and will generate results of commands which <br />
    will be read from a command input ﬁle. <br />
    For further problem description please review the file "BBM104-Experiment_5.pdf" in the "res" folder.
